                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the most magnificent monuments of
                                not
                                only the city of Calcutta but of our entire country. Representing the resplendent and
                                majestic British architecture, Victoria Memorial Hall stands today, as a veritable icon
                                of
                                the city of Kolkata. Located on 1 Queen’s way, the VMH was envisaged by Lord Curzon, the
                                Viceroy of British India, as a memorial to the deceased Queen Victoria. Hence, according
                                to
                                Curzon this memorial should take form of a great marble hall, which was to be erected on
                                the
                                Calcutta maidan to serve primarily as a monument to the Queen and secondarily as a
                                national
                                gallery and Valhalla of the Indian Empire.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The national gallery which Curzon speaks about would in future take the shape of a
                                museum.
                                The Victoria Memorial hall was therefore set up to function more than just a memorial
                                for
                                the deceased Queen Victoria. The memorial was to be designed with a museum housed within
                                its
                                realms. The memorial with the museum would act as a “standing record of our wonderful
                                history” This was to be a historical museum where people could see before them pictures
                                and
                                statues of men who played a prominent part in the history of this country and develop a
                                pride in their past. Curzon’s writing bring forth that it was a part of his imperial
                                duty to
                                put into execution to set up a “Great Imperial memorial worthy of Queen Victoria and
                                worthy
                                of India.

                                Within few weeks after Queen’ death in January 1901 a great meeting was convened in the
                                Town
                                Hall of Calcutta on 6th February, 1901, whereby a resolution for constituting an all
                                Indian
                                Memorial Fund for building of the memorial was moved. The princes and people of India
                                responded Architects generously to his appeal for funds and the total cost of
                                construction
                                of this monument amounting to one crore, five lakhs of rupees, was entirely derived from
                                their voluntary subscriptions. King George V, the then Prince of Wales, laid the
                                foundation
                                stone on January 4, 1906 and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.
