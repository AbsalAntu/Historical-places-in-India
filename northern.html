                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but
                                work
                                continued on other
                                phases of the project for another 10 years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was
                                an
                                observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of

                                Mahal. The mausoleum was opened at that time to thousands of mourners.

                                The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a
                                cost
                                estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35
                                billion (US$498 million).[9] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans
                                under
                                the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court
                                architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural
                                beauty and divinity.

                                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the
                                jewel of
                                Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's
                                heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a
                                symbol of
                                India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,[10] and in

                                was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                                Lal Kila, or Lal Qal'ah, is a historic fort built in Old Delhi in the 17th century.
                                Built by
                                the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who also built the Taj Mahal, it gets its popular
                                nickname of
                                "the Red Fort" due to the use of red sandstone in its construction. The fort was
                                originally
                                red and white, but the British demolished some of the white marble structures and
                                painted it
                                all red to further cement its common name of the Red Fort of Delhi. A symbol of the
                                achievements of the Mughal Empire before British rule, the fortress is commonly seen as
                                a
                                national symbol of India, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is among the country's

                                There was actually an earlier red fort built in Delhi much earlier. This first Red Fort
                                of
                                Delhi was called Lal Kot and built by the Tomar Rajput dynasty, which had its capital at
                                Delhi. Some sources place the construction of this fort in the 8th century, while others
                                date it to the 11th century. It was later expanded, but the Hindu and Jain temples in
                                the
                                complex were destroyed after the Muslim conquest of India, and the fort fell largely
                                into
                                disrepair. Ruins of the walls can still be seen today though.

                                In the 1500s, the Mughal Empire came to dominate much of India, and massive building
                                projects showed off the wealth and cultural achievements of this empire. The empire's
                                architectural achievements reached a zenith under the fifth emperor, Shah Jahan.

                                He oversaw the construction of the Red Fort beginning in 1638. The Lal Kila was built as
                                part of Shah Jahan's decision to move his capital from Agra to Delhi. This second Red
                                Fort
                                of Delhi, the one that is famous today, was built in a completely different site from
                                the
                                earlier fort and would be much larger.

                                The Red Fort was later used as a garrison during the British rule of India. Upon
                                independence on August 15, 1947, India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru raised
                                the
                                Indian flag over the Red Fort, starting a tradition that is reenacted every year on

                                Independence Day. This ritual has helped cement the fort's status as a national symbol
                                of
                                India. In 2007, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in honor of its
                                representation
                                of Indian architectural and cultural achievement and status as an important site.

                                The Mughal Empire was founded in 1526 by Babur after his conquest of Agra and Delhi. The
                                empire would grow in subsequent years under Babur's successors and rule most of
                                present-day
                                northern India and Pakistan. Especially under Akbar the Great, the Mughal Empire grew
                                into a
                                powerful and prosperous empire. Great buildings and works of art became important
                                symbols of
                                Mughal achievement.

                                <br>
                                This was especially the case under Shah Jahan, who commissioned a number of important
                                building projects, including the Great Mosque of Agra. He ordered the construction of
                                the
                                Red Fort when he moved the capital of the empire from Agra to Delhi in 1638. This was
                                around
                                the same time that Shah Jahan's most famous building project was completed - the Taj
                                Mahal
                                mausoleum, which was built for his first wife who died in childbirth.

                                In fact, Shah Jahan commissioned the same architect, Ustad Ahmad Lahori, to build the
                                Red
                                Fort. A combined fort and palace complex, it was meant to be the seat of government in
                                the
                                new capital. It took 10 years to complete, with construction finishing in 1648. It would
                                become the center of life in the capital city of Old Delhi (then known as
                                Shahjahanabad),
                                the main site of residence for the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years, and a powerful
                                symbol of Mughal rule. Inside the 75-foot-high walls was an elaborate layout of palace
                                residences, canals, gardens, and even a majestic mosque.

                                architectural members of 27 Hindu and Jaina temples which were demolished by Qutbu'd-Din
                                Aibak as recorded in his inscription on the main eastern entrance.

                                <br>
                                Later, a lofty arched screen was erected and the mosque was enlarged by Shamsu'd-Din
                                Iltutmish (AD 1210-35) and Alau'd-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an
                                inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century AD, according to which the
                                pillar
                                was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in
                                memory of a mighty king named Chandra. A deep socket on the top of the ornate capital
                                indicates that probably an image of Garuda was fixed into it.

                                The tomb of Iltutmish (AD 1211-36) was built in AD 1235. It is a plain square chamber of
                                red
                                sandstone, profusely carved with inscriptions, geometrical and arabesque patterns in
                                Saracenic tradition on the entrances and the whole of interior. Some of the motifs viz.,
                                the
                                wheel, tassel etc., are reminiscent of Hindu designs.

                                Ala'i-Darwaza, the southern gateway of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque was constructed by
                                Alau'd-Din Khalji in AH 710 (AD 1311) as recorded in the inscriptions engraved on it.
                                This
                                is the first building employing Islamic principles of construction and ornamentation.

                                Ala'i Minar which stands to the north of Qutb-Minar, was commenced by Alau'd-Din Khalji,
                                with the intention of making it twice the size of earlier Minar. He could complete only
                                the
                                first storey which now has an extant height of 25 m. The other remains in the Qutb

                                This stupendous structure was constructed by the Imperial War Graves Commission aka
                                IWCG,
                                which was established in 1917 to build war memorials and graves for soldiers who lose

                                lives in the First World War. The memorial was designed by a famous English architect by

                                name Sir Edwin Lutyens and its foundation was laid by the Duke of Connaught, third son

                                Queen Victoria, on 10 February 1921. After 10 long years, on February 12, 1931, Viceroy

                                names of over 13,000 soldiers who lost their lives during the war are also inscribed on

                                structure was added to the India Gate in 1972. Known as Amar Jawan Jyoti (which means

                                Flame of the Immortal Soldier), this was inaugurated by Indira Gandhi, who was the then

                                Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed the India Gate, was a leading war memorial architect and
                                was
                                also a member of IWGC. He built it as a secular memorial free of any religious
                                association
                                or cultural ornamentation. Also, Lutyens wanted the monument to be a classical one, so
                                refused to incorporate any Asian motifs such as pointed arches. The architectural style
                                of
                                India Gate is that of a triumphal arch and is often compared with the Arc de Triomphe in
                                Paris, the Gateway of India in Mumbai, and theÂ Arch of Constantine.

                                Situated in the middle of a hexagonal complex, the structure is 42 meters tall and 9.1
                                meters wide. The whole structure is made using yellow and red sandstone which was
                                brought in
                                directly from Bharatpur.

                                About 150 meters towards the east of the India Gate, there is a canopy that was built in
                                1936 as a tribute to former Emperor of India,Â King George V. There used to be a marble
                                statue of George V, but it was removed due to opposition from some political parties
                                after
                                Indiaâs independence. Currently the statue is located in Delhi’s Coronation Park.

                                India Gate also houses a small structure called Amar Jawan Jyoti, which consists of a

                                pedestal with a cenotaph on its top. The cenotaph has the words âAmar Jawanâ written
                                on
                                all four sides in golden letters and also has a reversed rifle, capped by a soldier

                                installed on it. The structure is surrounded by permanently burning flames fueled by CNG

                                India Gate: Today
                                Today, the India Gate holds much significance not only as a tourist attraction but also
                                a
                                symbol of nationalism. Every year, on 26th January, the Republic Day parade commences
                                from
                                the gates of the Rashtrapati Bhavan (the Presidentâs residence) and progresses past

                                India Gate.Â Wreaths are placed at the Amar Jawan Jyoti by the Prime Minister of
                                India on that day.
