                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 8th century Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is one of the 108 temples
                                in India dedicated
                                to
                                Lord Vishnu. In this temple, you will find Lord Vishnu reclining on the hooded serpent
                                Anantha.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was during the time of King Marthanda Varma that this temple saw a major renovation.
                                What
                                we see today is the result of the meticulous renovation work on the ancient temple. The
                                devout King Marthanda Varma took it upon himself and the royal family to look after the
                                temple and the people of the state/kingdom. This was followed by the tradition of
                                Thripadidanam, the donation to the temple and its deity. The last Maharaja of Travancore
                                Maharaja Sree Padmanabha Dasa Sree Chithira Thirunal Bala Rama Varma, in 1965, formed
                                the
                                Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple Trust to continue religious offerings and donations.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To this day, the temple is run by a trust headed by the royal family. The donation is
                                not
                                confined to those residing in the state, it can be from anywhere and anyone. Though
                                entry to
                                the temple is only allowed to the Hindus. And it is because of this donation that we are
                                here discussing this.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The date of the temple’s foundation is unknown. But as per popular beliefs, it was
                                established about 5000 years ago.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The palm leaf records at the temple mention that sage Divakara Muni Vilwamangalam
                                founded it. He performed rituals at Padmanabhaswamy Temple Kasaragod, also known as
                                Ananthapura Lake Temple. And that temple is said to be the original seat (moolasthanam)
                                of Anantha Padmanabhaswamy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As per the legends, Lord Vishnu appeared before sage Vilwamangalam as an orphan kid. The
                                sage felt pity and allowed him to stay at the temple. He took his help in the daily
                                activities of the temple. One day, Vilwamangalam acted harshly on the kid, who then, ran
                                away towards the forest.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But, Vilwamangalam soon realized that the boy was Lord Vishnu himself. So, he went to
                                find him. He followed him inside a cave, which led to present-day Thiruvananthapuram.
                                The boy then disappeared into a mahua tree. The tree fell and took the shape of Lord
                                Vishnu lying on the thousand hooded serpent – Adi Shesha.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The size of Lord Vishnu in this Ananthasayanam posture extended up to 8 miles, and sage
                                Vilwamangalam requested him to condense to a smaller size. Lord shrank, but still, the
                                sage couldn’t see him completely. Trees obstructed his view, and he could see Lord
                                Anantha in three parts - the face, the stomach area and the feet.

                                The doors of Shri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram) show the
                                large idol in the same way as the sage saw the lord.

                                History of Padmanabhaswamy Temple Trivandrum
                                Although the exact date of the temple construction isn’t known, the earliest mention of
                                the temple dates to the 9th century.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Later, during the 15th century, the roof of sanctum sanctorum was repaired, as mentioned
                                in the palm leaf records. The Ottakkal Mandapam in the premises was built about the same
                                time. And around the mid-17th century, King Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma ordered
                                major renovations in the temple.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The sanctum sanctorum was reconstructed, and the old idol was replaced by a statue made
                                of 12,008 shaligram stones and various herbs, collectively called katu-sharkara. By
                                1739, the work on the statue was completed. The king also built the stone corridor, the
                                gate and the flagstaff.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Then, in 1750, he dedicated his kingdom to the lord, in the Thrippadidanam ceremony.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In 1758, the pillared outdoor hall – Karthika Mandapam, was built by king Karthika
                                Thirunal Rama Varma. And in 1820, during the time of queen Gowri Parvathi Bayi, the
                                large Anantha Shyana mural was drawn.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Another major event in Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple history was recorded in 1936, during
                                the reign of Chithira Thirunal Rama Varma. He outlined the Kshethra Praveshan Vilambram
                                (or Temple Entry Proclamation) to allow every Hindu caste and creed in the temple.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Architecture of Padmanabhaswamy Temple
                                Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple Trivandrum stands out for the detailed work in stone and
                                bronze. The architecture is a fusion of Dravidian architectural style and Kerala style,
                                and the temple resembles Adi Kesava Perumal temple of Thiruvattar. Even the deities look
                                similar, lying in a reclining posture.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The magnificent seven-tier high gopuram, carved with elaborate designs, is the first
                                structure you will notice. The large corridor inside is supported by beautifully carved
                                stone pillars and sculptures of various Hindu deities. Beautiful murals also adorn the
                                walls and ceilings in various parts of the temple.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Inside the sanctum, Sri Padmanabha reclines on Adi Shesha whose hoods form an umbrella
                                over his head. The sanctum has three doors from which you can look at the reclining
                                18-foot idol of Lord Padmanabha.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Shri Padmanabhaswamy Temple Treasure
                                Padmanabhaswamy Temple is the richest temple in the world. The Padmanabhaswamy Temple
                                trust, headed by the royal family of Travancore, looks after the assets.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The treasure is a collection of valuable objects accumulated over several thousands of
                                years. It includes coins, statues, ornaments and many other precious artefacts, donated
                                by rulers and traders from around the world.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The list includes kings from South Indian kingdoms like the Cheras, the Pandyas and the
                                Pallavas, rulers from Greece, Jerusalem, Rome and other traders who came to visit the
                                temple. Donations also poured in from various colonial powers of Europe.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And because of its wealth, the temple has also been referred to as the Golden Temple in
                                various literatures.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The palm leaves records tell a lot about Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure, and the gold
                                and precious stones donated to the temple.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Gold has been mined in and around Trivandrum for thousands of years. And the area has
                                also been a centre of trade. So, the gold came to the temple as offerings from the
                                devotees. Many royal families in Southern India too stored their wealth in the temple
                                vaults for safekeeping.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Also, during the reign of queen Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, many temples in Kerala were bought
                                under the royal governance. And the ornaments and other valuables of those temples were
                                stored in the vaults of Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Kingdom of Travancore also provided
                                refuge to many rulers who then donated their valuables to Lord Padmanabha.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Most of the records are yet to be studied, and out of the six known vaults, one still
                                hasn’t been opened. Authorities also discovered two vaults later, both unexplored.

                                built in the 16th–17th centuries. According to Hindu legend, the god Shiva came to

                                ruler; Meenakshi was a manifestation of the goddess Parvati. The Meenakshi Amman Temple
                                is dedicated to their union.

                                The massive temple is enclosed by high walls entered through soaring gopuras, or gateway
                                towers. Inside are colonnades, columned mandapas (halls, some of which were used for
                                shops, storerooms, and stables), a sacred tank, lesser shrines, and, at the centre, the
                                two main shrines to Sundareswarar and Meenakshi. The gopuras are some of the most
                                elaborately decorated in India. Brightly painted, they are completely covered with
                                figures of divinities, celestial beings, monster masks, guardians, and animal mounts.
                                The tallest of the 14, the southern gopura, rises to more than 170 feet (52 m).

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gateway of India is one of India's most unique landmarks situated
                                in the city of Mumbai. The colossal structure was constructed in 1924. Located at the
                                tip of Apollo Bunder, the gateway overlooks the Mumbai harbor, bordered by the Arabian
                                Sea in the Colaba district. The Gateway of India is a monument that marks India's chief
                                ports and is a major tourist attraction for visitors who arrive in India for the first
                                time. At one point of time, this monument represented the grandeur of the British Raj in
                                India. The total construction cost of this monument was approximately 21 lakhs and the
                                whole expense was borne by the Indian government. A favourite spot for tourists,
                                nowadays, this monument attracts vendors, food stalls and photographers. The passing of
                                the 'First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry' was recorded as the first main
                                event that took place at the Gateway of India. This ceremony was conducted on February
                                28, 1948, when the last set of British troops and divisions left India,
                                post-independence.

                                History
                                The main objective behind the construction of the Gateway of India was to commemorate
                                the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Bombay (Mumbai). In March 1911, Sir George
                                Sydenham Clarke, who was then the Governor of Bombay, laid down the monument's first
                                foundation. Although, this plan was approved only in 1914, the reclamations at Apollo
                                Bunder were completed only in 1919. The architectural design of Gateway of India was
                                fashioned by architect, George Wittet. It took 4 years to complete this monument's
                                construction.

                                Architectural Layout
                                The structural design of the Gateway of India is constituted of a large arch, with a
                                height of 26m. The monument is built in yellow basalt and indissoluble concrete. The
                                structural plan of Gateway of India is designed in the Indo-Saracenic style. One can
                                also find traces of Muslim architectural styles incorporated in the structure of the
                                grandiose edifice. The central dome of the monument is about 48 feet in diameter, with a
                                total height of 83 feet. Designed with intricate latticework, the 4 turrets are the
                                prominent features of the entire structure of the Gateway of India. There are steps
                                constructed behind the arch of the Gateway that leads to the Arabian Sea. The monument
                                is structured in such a way that one can witness the large expanse of the 'blue blanket'
                                right ahead, welcoming and sending off ships and visitors.

                                Visiting Hours
                                People can visit the monument at any time of the day. The best time to visit the Gateway
                                of India is during the period of November to March, as the post-monsoon climate is very
                                pleasant and there are very less chances for downpours at this time.

                                One of India's prized monuments, the Gateway of India was built in 1924. The Gateway of
                                India is a major tourist hub in the city, which is located at Apollo Bunder Waterfront
                                in Southern Mumbai. This monument was built to welcome King George V and Queen Mary to
                                Mumbai and years later, the last horde of British troops left India
                                through this gateway.
