                            Jaipur was founded by Kachhwaha Rajput ruler Jai Singh II on 18 November 1727, who ruled the
                            region from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amber, 11 kilometres (7 mi)
                            to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water. Jai
                            Singh consulted with several architects while planning the layout of Jaipur and established
                            the city on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra under the architectural
                            guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. The construction of the city began in 1726. During
                            the rule of Sawai Ram Singh II, the city was painted pink to welcome Albert Edward, Prince
                            of Wales in 1876. Many of the avenues still0 remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a
                            distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.

                            In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and had a population of 160,000 in 1900. The wide
                            boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and marble,
                            fostered by a school of art founded in 1868. In August 1981, large areas of the city
                            including the airport were flooded due to heavy rains from a cloud burst, resulting in the
                            death of eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River. On 6 July
                            2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list.
