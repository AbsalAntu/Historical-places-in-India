                                The group of temples of Khajuraho testifies to the culmination of northern Indian temple
                                art
                                and
                                architecture of the Chandella dynasty who ruled the region in the 10th and 11th
                                centuries
                                CE.
                                Distributed over an area of 6 square km in a picturesque landscape, the 23 temples
                                (including one partly
                                excavated structure) that form the western, eastern, and southern clusters of the
                                Khajuraho
                                Group of
                                Monuments are rare surviving examples that display the originality and high quality of
                                Nagara-style
                                temple architecture.

                                The Khajuraho Group of Monuments demonstrates in layout and physical form, the pinnacle
                                of
                                temple
                                architectural development in northern India. Built in sandstone, each temple is elevated
                                from its
                                environs by a highly ornate terraced platform, or jagati, on which stands the body, or
                                jangha, whose
                                sanctum is topped by a tower, or shikhara, of a type unique to Nagara, where the
                                verticality
                                of the
                                principal spire atop the sanctum is accentuated by a series of miniature spires flanking
                                it,
                                each
                                symbolizing Mount Kailasa, the abode of the Gods.

                                The plan of the temples shows the spatial hierarchy of axially aligned interconnected
                                spaces. The
                                temples are entered through an ornate entrance porch (ardhamandapa), which leads to the
                                main
                                hall
                                (mandapa), through which one accesses the vestibule (antarala) before reaching the
                                sanctum
                                (garbhagriha). The main halls of the temples were often accompanied by lateral transepts
                                with projecting
                                windows as well as a circumambulatory path around the sanctum. Larger temples had an
                                additional pair of
                                transepts and were accompanied by subsidiary shrines on the four corners of its jagati.

                                The temples of Khajuraho are known for the harmonious integration of sculptures with
                                their
                                architecture.
                                All surfaces are profusely carved with anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic motifs
                                depicting sacred
                                and secular themes. Sculptures depicting acts of worship, clan and minor deities, and
                                couples in union,
                                all reflect the sacred belief system. Other themes mirror social life through depictions
                                of
                                domestic
                                scenes, teachers and disciples, dancers and musicians, and amorous couples. The
                                composition
                                and finesse
                                achieved by the master craftsmen give the stone surfaces of the Khajuraho temples a rare
                                vibrancy and
                                sensitivity to the warmth of human emotions.

                                numerous scenes of amusements that includes scenes susceptible to various
                                interpretations,
                                sacred or

                                Criterion (iii): The temples of Khajuraho bear an exceptional testimony to the Chandella
                                culture, which
                                flourished in central India before the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate at the

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun Temple at Konârak, located on the eastern shores of the Indian
                                subcontinent, is
                                one of the outstanding examples of temple architecture and art as revealed in its
                                conception, scale and proportion, and in the sublime narrative strength of its
                                sculptural embellishment. It is an outstanding testimony to the 13th-century kingdom of
                                Orissa and a monumental example of the personification of divinity, thus forming an
                                invaluable link in the history of the diffusion of the cult of Surya,the Sun God. In
                                this sense, it is directly and materially linked to Brahmanism and tantricbelief
                                systems. The Sun Temple is the culmination of Kalingan temple architecture, with all its
                                defining elements in complete and perfect form. A masterpiece of creative genius in both
                                conception and realisation, the temple represents a chariot of the Sun God, with twelve
                                pairs of wheels drawn by seven horses evoking its movement across the heavens. It is
                                embellished with sophisticated and refined iconographical depictions of contemporary
                                life and activities. On the north and south sides are 24 carved wheels, each about 3 m
                                in diameter, as well as symbolic motifs referring to the cycle of the seasons and the
                                months. These complete the illusionary structure of the temple-chariot. Between the
                                wheels, the plinth of the temple is entirely decorated with reliefs of fantastic lions,
                                musicians and dancers, and erotic groups. Like many Indian temples, the Sun Temple
                                comprises several distinct and well-organized spatial units. The vimana (principal
                                sanctuary) was surmounted by a high tower with a shikhara (crowning cap), which was
                                razed in the 19th century. To the east, the jahamogana (audience hall) dominates the
                                ruins with its pyramidal mass. Farther to the east, the natmandir (dance hall), today
                                unroofed, rises on a high platform. Various subsidiary structures are still to be found
                                within the enclosed area of the rectangular wall, which is punctuated by gates and
                                towers.The Sun Temple is an exceptional testimony, in physical form, to the 13th-century
                                Hindu Kingdom of Orissa, under the reign of Narasimha Deva I (AD 1238-1264). Its scale,
                                refinement and conception represent the strength and stability of the Ganga Empire as
                                well as the value systems of the historic milieu. Its aesthetical and visually
                                overwhelming sculptural narratives are today an invaluable window into the religious,
                                political, social and secular life of the people of that period. The Sun Templeis
                                directly associated with the idea and belief of the personification of the Sun God,
                                which is adumbrated in the Vedas and classical texts. The Sun is personified as a divine
                                being with a history, ancestry, family, wives and progeny, and as such, plays a very
                                prominent role in the myths and legends of creation. Furthermore, it is associated with
                                all the legends of its own artistic creation – the most evocative being its construction
                                over twelve years using 1,200 artisans – and the stories about the deep commitment of
                                its master builder, Bisu Moharana, to the project, in which his son (who was born during
                                this period) later became involved. Konârak’s location and name are important
                                testimonies to all the above associations, and its architectural realisation is
                                associated with the living traditions of Brahmanismand tantricpractices.

                                Criterion (i): A unique artistic achievement, the temple has raised up those lovely
                                legends which are affiliated everywhere with absolute works of art: its construction
                                caused the mobilization of 1,200 workers for 12 years. The architect, Bisu Moharana,
                                having left his birthplace to devote himself to his work, became the father of a son
                                while he was away. This son, in his turn, became part of the workshop and after having
                                constructed the cupola of the temple, which his father was unable to complete, immolated
                                himself by jumping into space.

                                invaluable link in the history of the diffusion of the cult of Surya, which originating
                                in Kashmir during the 8th century, finally reached the shores of Eastern India.

                                The boundaries of the nominated property encompass the attributes necessary to represent
                                the Outstanding Universal Value of the Sun Temple, Konârak. Within the inscribed and
                                protected extent of the property, its surviving structures and sculptures, as well as
                                the dislodged remains preserved in-situ, represent its quintessential qualities of
                                architectural form, design and sculptural relief. Furthermore, the protected zone
                                includes all areas that have the potential to reveal any unexplored archaeological
                                remains that may possibly enhance the understanding of the property’s Outstanding
                                Universal Value. Identified and potential threats to the integrity of the property
                                include development pressure: modernisation and urban growth affecting the environment
                                of the monument; environmental pressure: deforestation due to cyclones and human
                                activities, saline breeze and sand blasting, vehicular movements, and microbiological
                                growth; tourism pressure: 40% increase in number of tourists; natural disasters: flood
                                and cyclones; and local population growth. An extension of the site boundaries and the
                                buffer zone around the property by land acquisition has been recommended for the better
                                management of the site. Concerns over the structural integrity of elements of the site
                                have been raised in the past, including the impact of monsoon rains and associated soil
                                erosion. In addition, erosion of metal cramps supporting the structure due to salt air
                                has in the past resulted in some damage.

                                The Sun Temple’s authenticity of form and design is maintained in full through the
                                surviving edifices, their placement within the complex, structures and the integral link
                                of sculpture to architecture. The various attributes of the Sun Temple, including its
                                structures, sculptures, ornamentation and narratives, are maintained in their original
                                forms and material. Its setting and location are maintained in their original form, near
                                the shore of the Bay of Bengal. In preserving the attributes as stated, the Sun Temple,
                                Konârak repeatedly evokes the strong spirit and feeling associated with the structure,
                                which is manifested today in the living cultural practices related to this property,
                                such as the Chandrabhanga festival.

                                that may have adverse effects on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property. All
                                conservation programmes are undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India through its
                                national, regional and local representatives. There are five management-related plans:

                                Heritage funding was received to carry out an assessment of structural
                                stability.Sustaining the Outstanding Universal Value of the property over time will
                                require continuing the structural and material conservation of the main Jagamohana
                                structure and its sculptures; establishing a stronger functional integration of local
                                and central authorities; including the larger landscape setting into the regulated area
                                for development; and addressing the identified threats related to development pressure,

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is
                                said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was
                                built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the actual reason behind building
                                Charminar is still not clear.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the
                                plague which had affected the entire city immensely during that era. It is believed that
                                the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering.
                                Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to Allah. The four
                                pillars are also said to be dedicated to the first four caliphs of Islam.

                                <br>
                                It is also said that it was built in the memory of Prophet Muhammed’s son in law who
                                lost his life at the battle of Karbala as its design is in the shape of Shiya Tazias.
                                Some also believe that the location of Charminar is the place where Sultan had seen his
                                then future wife Bahgmati for the first time.

                                As per a French traveller, Jean de Thévenot who travelled in the 17th century, the
                                reason for its construction is entirely different. According to his narration which is
                                in sync with the Persian texts as well, Charminar was built to commemorate the start of
                                the second Islamic millennium.

                                The inscription on the foundation stone is translated as ‘Fill this my city with people
                                as, Thou hast filled the river with fishes, O Lord.’ This also indicates that the
                                monument was built to mark the city’s foundation as well. As per the historian Historian
                                Mohammed Safiullah, Charminar was built as an epicenter of Hyderabad.

                                The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years with a cost of Rs. 9
                                lakhs, which was around 2 lakhs huns/gold coins in those times. It is said to weigh
                                around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had
                                fallen down after being struck by lightning. It was then repaired at a cost of around
                                Rs.58000 then. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost of Rs. 2
                                lakhs.

                                There is another legend associated with the Charminar according to which, there is a
                                secret underground tunnel that connects Charminar to the Golconda Fort. It was built for
                                the royal family, to escape in case of any kind of emergencies. However, till date no
                                tunnel could be found.

                                Architecture of Charminar
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                An Iranian architect Mir Momin Astrawadi, who had settled in Hyderabad, designed
                                Charminar. It presents an imposing structure which has clearly withstood the test of
                                time. It is a square shaped monument with four pillars, one on each side. The
                                architectural design of Charminar is inspired from the Shia “tazias”. These Tazias were
                                built in the memory of Hussain, who was the son in law of Prophet Muhhamed and had lost
                                his life in the battle of Karbala.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The square shape of the monument measures 20 meters on each side. Each side of the
                                monument is 11 meter wide and overlooks the four prominent thoroughfares. Charminar has
                                been built with granite and lime mortar.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The four pillars around Charminar represent the four caliphs. These pillars or minars
                                are 48.7 meters high. These are four stories, with each floor divided by intricately
                                carved rings that surround it. On the top floor of Chaminar there is a mosque which is
                                believed to be the oldest mosque of Hyderabad city. There are 45 prayer spaces or
                                musallah. Attached to these is the open space which can be used to accommodate more
                                people on occasions like Friday prayers or festivals. It is located at the western end
                                of the monument’s roof. It can be reached via 149 winding steps. The view from the top
                                is also breathtaking.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the middle of the Charminar courtyard, you will find a small vazu with a small
                                fountain, which has been built to provide water for the ablution before offering
                                prayers.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                One can also notice the signature motifs of Qutub Shahi buildings on Charminar. The
                                manner with which each pillar has been built makes it appear as a lotus leaf. The arches
                                around the structure do lead to slightly shorter appearance when in comparison to the
                                minars. In the year of 1889, four clocks were also added on all the four sides
                                of the structure.

                                History of the Gwalior fort (Gwalior Kila)
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                According to historians, the earliest foundation of Gwalior Fort (Gwalior Kila) may have
                                been laid in the 6th century AD by Suraj Sen, a Rajput warrior. A fascinating story of
                                Gwalior says that a saint named Gwalipa came wandering to the fort and met the king, who
                                was suffering from a skin disease. When Gwalipa suggested him to take a dip in the
                                sacred pond (now called Suraj Kund), the king was immediately cured. And in gratitude,
                                Suraj Sen named the city Gwalior after the sage.

                                <br>
                                After being attacked and ruled by various rulers, the Tomars captured the fort in 1398.
                                The most celebrated of the Tomars was Maan Singh. He was the one who constructed several
                                monuments inside the fort complex. The beautiful turquoise blue-tiled Man Mandir Palace
                                was also built during his reign.

                                <br>
                                After the Tomars, the Mughals ruled Gwalior. With the decline of the Mughals, Marathas,
                                specifically the Schindias ruled Gwalior until the early 19th century. The last assault
                                upon this great fort was led by legendary freedom fighters, the valiant queen of Jhansi
                                and Tantiya Tope during the battle of 1857.

                                the legends, it was built using money donated by oil merchants. Hence, it was named Teli
                                Ka Mandir. Tourists can also find this information in the inscription written on the
                                main gate of the temple.

                                were built around 1093. The larger Sas temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, has open
                                galleries on all sides, creating a beautiful play of light and shadow on its walls. The
                                smaller Bahu temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Some historians claim that the Sas-Bahu
                                temples were originally called Sahastrabahu.

                                When entering the fort through Urwahi Gate, one must witness the fascinating rock-cut
                                sculptures of Jain Tirthankaras. The most impressive of these are a 17 m tall standing
                                statue of Adinath, the first Jain Tirthankara, distinguished by the symbol of the bull;
                                a 10 m seated figure of Neminath, the 22nd Tirthankara, with the symbol of a shell; and
                                a 19 m tall Parshwanath, distinguished by the cobra motif forming a hood
                                behind his head.
